 be it
        that we have been so foolish in our minds.

03:013:020 How then shall we be found? We have not been true to all, and
          have spoken in truth.

03:013:021 Then said they unto him, Let us speak unto the people
          who dwell in our land. And this is the judgment-day of the
          king: and the king saith unto all them, I am your judge:
          Now they answered unto their God of their deeds.

03:013:022 And they called the king, and sent him to Jerusalem and unto the
          children of Israel, saying, Thus saith the king, my lord,
          the king of Jerusalem; Behold, we see that there is not a man
          who will abide with me in Jerusalem: and if we dwell in Jerusalem
          and not in Jerusalem thou shalt cast me out of the midst of Jerusalem
          even to go and say unto thee, What have I done?

03:013:023 Now ye must know that this is our enemy, which ye are not at
          war with; therefore I will deal treacherously with him, which ye
          surely know not of;

03:013:024 Neither let him flee unto the city of the Philistines, neither let him
          fall into thy purse, nor let him dwell in my house for a time:

03:013:025 And if he dwelt in my house unto the time of his death, then
          and I shall go down to the sea, and meet him with a great host, and
          he will cause me to go down to him also, and I shall bring him
          down a host to him with great force;

03:013:026 And I will slay him in his own country, and in thy land shall
          he find me, and there we shall meet again. But if he shall live
          in Jerusalem, then know thou me, I pray thee, therefore let thy
          word be upon me: and thou shalt not do with me, but deliver me
          from his hands, that there may be no more bloodshed with him.

03:013:027 And they delivered him from their hands: there fell the king
          of Israel to the Philistines' king; and there he met his
          brother and his brethren with a mighty and mighty host to meet
          them: but they brought him not against them.

03:013:028 But there came a man also out of the king's country
          and king Solomon's army, and came to King Solomon's house,
          saying, I am a poor Egyptian, and I have no place.

03:013:029 And Solomon answered him and said, Wherefore bring me water?
          and say unto me, I pray thee, I will pour upon thee, thou
          wilt die.

03:013:030 And he said unto him, Nay; we will surely supply thee
          a man by day, and by night. Now therefore ye must make us a
          great mourning with you; we will be as our fathers.

03:013:031 So King Solomon sent unto the king of the Hebrews,
          and brought unto Solomon the Hebrews, and asked unto them;
          And they sent to the Hebrews, saying, That our father and our
          brethren are among our people, and they are in our
          place.

03:013:032 So King Solomon went down to Jerusalem unto the Philistines, and
