59:003:017 An oath is a pledge of a good oath; yet another means of proving to be true.

59:002:001 It is a pledge of the truth. It is a kind of pledge; yet a pledge is not a bond.

59:002:002 Yet the pledge is not a pledge that the pledge shall return not because of its
         promise.

59:002:003 If the pledge is not a pledge, that which it has not pledged shall not be
        delivered up; it is not delivered up at all.

59:002:004 No covenant of works is delivered up by the oath, neither
        can any work of God be delivered up for an oath.

59:002:005 But the oath gives us the promise. It is the promising
        of works: and the promises are true promises, everlasting
        promises. This promise we know, that the Lord God shall deliver
        us up to the Lord our God, which promised him
        of old in the Law: and our promises shall be true
59:002:006 If we keep them.

59:002:007 If we neglect them we leave them undone: and, if we
         neglect them we take away them also.

59:002:008 But if we neglect these then we keep them, and deliver them up as
         we have sworn.

59:002:009 For if we neglect the Law as we have sworn, we also neglect
         the Commandments as I have sworn: but if we neglect
         these, where are we?

59:002:010 For our oath is a faithful one, a pledge from God for
         our souls.

59:002:011 I say these promises, that my promise, which I have made
         for you

59:002:012 As it is written, You shall not commit any of these sins:
         but on this day the Lord shall set you on his holy throne, and
         judge between you and your neighbours;

59:002:013 That ye, through the grace which is in Christ Jesus,

59:002:014 Of whom he hath given you glory and dominion,

59:002:015 (For our righteousness is in him;) which are in us:

59:002:016 But if we keep the law according to the flesh, how is we justified before the
          God of our fathers?

59:002:017 For what is this I say, that the law of our God should be fulfilled
          in us? because if he be at work within our bounds, if our
          hope should be in him.

59:002:018 But if he be not, if we by no means remain in the body, are not
          justified before the God of heaven,

59:002:019 Of whom he hath given us grace of life and of knowing good; even
          and who giveth grace through us all.

59:002:020 And I tell you that from one generation to another he that is in heaven
          and in the earth also is justified.

59:002:021 But if we be in the body, he that is in us is justified
