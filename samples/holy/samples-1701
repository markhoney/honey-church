              may be taken away to go to the promised land and to
              remain therein, that the LORD may bless them by means of another
             people

19:006:006 Then said he unto them, Thus saith the LORD, If thou
             have not believed, thou couldst trust in the LORD, and
             not in the words of thy brother, and have not believed him,
             then I will send an angel to tell thee that thou wouldst
            not believe the good word, but have believed the evil.

19:006:007 Then the chief priests, and the elders,
            and all that said to the Jews, If thou have not believed the
            word of the LORD, thou couldst trust in the LORD, and
            trust not in the words of thy brother.

19:006:008 But the Levites and all that said to the Jews, If thou
            trust not in the words of the LORD, then I have told thee
            that thou shouldest trust in the LORD: so the LORD hath
            forgiven him.

19:007:001 All the elders of Judah and Jerusalem, and all
            that were with them, took to heart the words which the
            LORD spake unto them upon the mount, and, behold,
            the mountains and the top of the hills, and all
            the hills of Israel, and all the valleys of the
            face of the land.

19:007:002 And in his fury the Lord caused the waters to burst
            out of the cities,

19:007:003 And caused the fountains,

19:007:004 And caused the water to be poured out upon every hill,
            and every city;

19:007:005 And all the people of Israel went and prophesied, saying
            unto them: If ye do not believe the words of the LORD, the
            sun will not shine: and if ye do not believe the words of
            the LORD, the LORD will not give you grace.

19:007:006 And the Jews believed them not, and spoke all these
            words: but the multitude, that went out from the mount, went
            forth out of Bethaven, and came to the house of Aaron.

19:007:007 And Aaron took the handmaids of the Levites, and
            put them as the damsels in a bag: and he also took
            the daughters. But Moses and Aaron sat by the side
            in the house: for the Israelites came and prophesied,
            saying, The LORD hath not revealed unto thee a wonderful
            thing: go to Aaron, and tell him, Come, and I will
            speak unto thee.

19:007:008 And he took the handmaids, and went unto the house; and
            when the women were entered, he told them that he had
            caused the waters to burst out of the cities, and
            all the towns of Israel, from Bethaven in the north,
            even unto mount Ephraim, and all the hills
