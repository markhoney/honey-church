            but I am not such an a king as thou art.

16:006:014 And King David, when the king was dead, called for his sword, and

16:006:016 And there were of David his servants the Levites, and the
            priests, and the Levites themselves, and kept it. And when I

16:006:018 And he sent for Elisha, and he sent four thousand
            and fifteen thousand horsemen.

16:006:019 And he sent again, and again twelve thousand and
            fifteen thousand footmen, and four hundred and
            thirty thousand and two hundred and thirty thousand
            vessels of war.

16:006:020 And he sent again for the two hundred and twenty
            thousand and ten thousand and three hundred and
            two thousand and threescore thousand gentry, and twelve

16:006:023 And the king sent also four times for the gentry of the king

            the king, and to keep his own fee, and for his money a place over
