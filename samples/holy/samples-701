29:032:013 My people, I have also seen the things of their fathers, and the things
           of their brethren;

29:032:014 Mine own soul is made of the pure thing; they are as the
          wind in her midst, and as the waves on the sea, and as the
          sand of the sea.

29:032:015 They have brought my soul upon my soul, I have seen what great things
           he hath done: but my soul was made of the spirit of the LORD, and my
           peace was made of the peace of the LORD.

29:032:016 I am not to be ashamed in my praise, because they know of
           their iniquities, but God was my saviour: in that of mine
           brethren he is made my saviour.

29:032:017 They also know of their own sin; they know that they have made
           themselves iniquities to serve Baalim, to God's delight and to God's
           peace.

29:033:001 Judah, the son of Haggai, was a high priest of the LORD in his
           days.

29:033:002 We gave him the fruit of the tree, and he had it, and gave him
           a blessing upon all his children.

29:033:003 And when he turned and left, after he had received the blessing
           of the LORD, he said, Thus saith the LORD; In the firstborn of
           Judah, my children, will ye eat flesh? shall ye eat, or will
           ye be cast into everlasting fire? is he that gives flesh to
           mine fleshless children a prophet?

29:033:004 Is he that giveth flesh to the fruit of the tree flesh to his
           children, or is he that giveth flesh to the fruit of the tree
           flesh to his children, or is he that giveth flesh to the fruit
           of the tree, or he that giveth flesh to the fruit of the tree
           to his sons?

29:033:005 For he saith, He shall eat, and he that bringeth the fruit of
           righteousness into his hands shall be made great: but the seed
           of the people which is in Israel shall be taken away with him. For this
           is my people's glory: they shall eat flesh, and shall be cast away.

29:039:001 He shall take the seed of the people which is in Israel before
           their heart. This is the praise of the LORD; the good of
           all their children: but the evil of their children are great.

29:039:002 The tree of their salvation, the fruit of their
           labour, the fruit of the knowledge of the LORD, the fruit
           of the promise, the blessing, the glory of the LORD.

29:039:003 This is the praise of the LORD: The good, which the LORD
           gave to all the people of his elect, and the good, which
           he will give to the children of his people, is full of
           the life of the LORD through them.

29:039:004 He giveth the life by the fruit of the fruit of the
           people, the seed of them that were before his seed, the
           seed of their labour, and the life, the blessing, and the
