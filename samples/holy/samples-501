       a man. And I looked at him upon the
             earth, and he said, Thou knowest that I am a man,
            and that thou art a good man.

24:017:023 And Moses said unto him, The LORD hath formed me
            unto the image of the LORD, to serve him. And he
            said, I am a man, and therefore have I been made.

24:017:024 And I saw in the LORD his works, and he was good; for that
            he had not been made by the hand of man. And I also saw
            his works among the people, and that he himself was good;
            because he had not been made by the hand of man.

24:017:025 And I also saw his works among the
            heathen, and that he himself was good, because of the
            greatness of his works, and his strength, and his
            strength.

24:017:026 And I saw his works among the women, and that he
            himself was good; because he had not been made by the
            hand of man. And I also saw his works among the
            heathen, and that he himself was good, because of his
            works.

24:017:027 And I saw his works among the heathens in the
            heathen, and that he also was good, because of his
            works.

24:018:001 And thou, O LORD of Israel, command me to prophesy
            falsely, and to speak unprofitable things, that in the
            name of the LORD I may be exalted in Israel: and I
            will say. I know thy word, and my work,
            because I have been sent from the LORD. And I will
            prophesy the false, saying, Thus saith the LORD, The LORD
            will not make to come out of Zion; for the LORD will not
            take from the land of Judah the city.

24:018:002 It comes to pass that on day of his word the prophets
            shall hear the words of him; and I will also give
            it unto them.

24:018:003 And he shall say unto them, Thus saith the LORD,

             Therefore sayeth the LORD, Thus saith the LORD,

24:018:004 Thus saith the LORD, Thus saith the LORD: Thus saith the LORD, the
             LORD will not lay up my people the land: for the land shall
             be utterly wasted: for the LORD will cut off my people altogether; from
             thee shall the land go down and not rise.

24:018:005 As it was, saith the LORD, when they were utterly
            crushed, and with no way passed away; the land which
            I swore unto their fathers, according to the covenant,
            shall be utterly desolate.

24:018:006 Thus saith the LORD, the land that I swore unto
            their fathers, according to the covenant, shall be utterly
            desolate; they shall not go down and not rise.
