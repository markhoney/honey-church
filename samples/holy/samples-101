3:005:006 But there are many other things I tell you, which thou shalt not go no further in, and which I know are not well
             seen.

3:005:007 But this is the cause, O King, that I say these things unto you:

3:005:008 Thou art the King's counsellor, and I the King his
           counsellor, and thy word is truth, and I the
          King's counsellor, and thy word is justice; but the
         words of the wicked and the wicked are in your mouth:
          and thou shalt not deliver them, and I the King will deliver
          thee: so tell me the words of the wicked, as the
          wickedness of my soul: and thou shalt say, If, when thou
          art king, thou keepest the commandments of my conscience:
          then thou art my brother, and I shall not be ashamed.

3:005:009 And the words of the wicked are in thy mouth, and I will
          the words of the wicked be spoken unto thee: and I will say again
         this day, that the words of the wickedness of the
         heart of the wicked is spoken unto thee, and I will say again that
         this day will I deliver him, and I will make a treaty, for
          this very time, whereby he is called unto your honor, from whom
         he has gone out to his place and iniquity, I will
         deliver him, and I will make a treaty between us, which
         he is to deliver his people, and I will have the word of the
         God with him, and to show unto him how the things are, for he
         will say, I have said the word: the words shall come to me, and I will
         deliver him, and I will make a treaty, and say unto him, I will have the
         word of the Almighty with thee, and to show thyself as a witness to
         me of your word, and I will make a treaty between thee, and I will have
         the Word with thee, and to show thyself, and to be ready to make a
         treaty and to go up again with thy people; and it is not a law:
3:005:009 And I will show my words by a covenant: and I will make a
         treaty, and tell my servants all, and every one, and the people I
         will tell the people the things in my heart, what I have said to them, therefore
         they will see and know if they have the word of the Almighty;
         and I will keep it, and say unto them, That I will keep it, for
         this is the work of the LORD, that I will keep it, but I will not make the
         treaty and my servant will make a treaty to the Lord, which he is to
         bring over against me in the morning, and if he make the treaty I will not
         make the treaty.

3:005:010 I will stand in the place of the LORD, and say unto him,
3:005:011 I will keep the words of the law; but I will not make the
         treaty, and my servant will not make the treaty:

3:005:012 And I will speak unto the people in the night, and say unto them
         the things which have troubled me, and I will speak them
         to them all, and I will make the treaty, and I will make the
