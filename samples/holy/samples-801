 terrible the sight: so that the
           people had no place to take shelter.

42:002:001 And the king was at Babylon to receive the king of Assyria; but he
            saw not the king of Assyria, neither the multitude of the gods that
            were among the people.

42:002:002 And he left his people: he fled from their people; he made for himself a
            place of refuge, and did all men honour with good, that he might be saved,
            which he should have saved with good.

42:002:003 And his land also came into the land of Elam, and unto him they
            said, Come unto us.

42:002:004 From thence he went from thence to Mizpeh unto Kedar unto
            Mizpeh;

42:002:005 And the king of Assyria took him, and carried him unto Meshegech, and slew
            him, and buried him with a great sepulchre,

42:002:006 And all the land of Elam took him and buried him with a great sepulchre,
            and burned him with fire.

42:002:007 And the earth also said, This man hath been slain: be thou mournful
            to the gods that were slain, and bow yourselves unto them, to mourn
            death.

42:002:008 And thou shalt carry the bodies of the slain in a sack to be burnt: thou
            shalt then gather them, and bury them in the land of thy inheritance,
            according to their bodies, as the king of Assyria has done unto him: and thou shalt
            bring them unto the land of thy inheritance, that the king of Assyria may know that
            they were slain by those of the gods that were slain.

42:002:009 And the king of Assyria said unto thee, Behold, I will gather thee
             together, and bring thee back into the country of thy fathers, and thou shalt be thy
             name there; then he shall know that thou wast slain.

42:002:010 Then thou shalt thou gather together the heads of thy people, and all thy kindred
             shall be one of the heads of thy people, after thine inheritance; thou shalt
             name thy sons after me; after the tribe of the sons of thy tribe shall ye be called; but thou
             shalt not speak unto them, nor have any intercourse with them.
and if thou shalt not speak unto them, and they know thou hast killed
             one of thy brethren, thou shalt bring the same unto thy king, and deliver him in
            as short pieces within thy city of the land; for ye have slain him; and ye shall
            bear the death of thy brother unto thee, because ye killed him, yea, even thy brother.

42:002:011 Moreover thou shalt cause ye the dead bodies of thy dead men to be delivered: and the corpse of thy
            dead men shall ye bury in a clean place, for ye are slain.
 "And ye shall give the corpse of thy dead man unto thee, and give unto
            him a token from your daughters.

42:002:012 And thou shalt give them a token unto him that be dead, for ye have slain him: then
            ye shall carry him to an place of your habitation beside a place of your habitation: ye shall put
            thy dead man in this place, and bury him therein: and
