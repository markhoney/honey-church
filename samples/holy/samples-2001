 :3 And they went back again into the land of the Philistines, and took
              the children of Moab and the king, and came and slew a thousand, and
             burnt the land, and went to war: and when they had made end of
             their army, and had taken their spoil of the land,

24:013:004 They fled before unto Joacim, and he and they fought.

24:013:005 And there was so much slaughter in that day: and there were
             slain after them two thousand of every tribe, and
             ten thousand of every city, and he wounded ten thousand of
             every tribe.

24:013:006 And Joacim went after Jehoiada, and slew him: they departed
             before the Philistines.

24:013:007 And he went after Jehoiada, and slew him: and they went
            down to Jehoiada, and fought; and Joacim fled before
            him.

24:013:008 And Joacim made the city a desolation; for all the
            Philistines had slain them in it.

24:013:009 And Israel said, What is this that is before our God?

24:013:010 And Joacim said unto him, That we should surely be a desolation,
            and our brethren an heritage to them: who also said, That we
           should have no God.

24:013:011 And Joacim said unto Israel, Lo, the day of our
           redemption will come soon, and there will be no salvation for our
           seed.

24:013:012 And the LORD God of Israel looked, and saw, and said to
           the LORD, Thus saith the LORD, and saith unto the LORD,
           The Philistines and the children of Ammon have destroyed all
           them that have not heard my words which have spoken to thee in
           time of trouble, and have destroyed all that have not
           delivered up the sword, and have desolated
           thee; and I will look after thee, and thou wilt keep
           the habitation of my temple.

24:013:013 And he said unto him, Hearken unto the voice of the
           LORD thy God; and the LORD shall come upon thee to bless,
           and will raise thee up from the dust.

24:013:014 And Israel said unto the LORD, Hearken unto the voice of the
           Philistines, that they may speak unto thee, and speak,
           and speak unto thy people. And Israel said to the
           LORD, What is this that is before me?

24:013:015 Then the voice said again in the land of Israel, And
           thou shalt not take thy heritage from the children of his
           house, but thou shalt not leave me, even for a stranger
           in the land of Canaan; and thou shalt not drive them out by
           the hand, but thy servant shall come.

24:013:016 And Joacim said to the LORD, Wilt thou give them
           unto their enemies? behold, there are yet some remaining
           upon the face of thine holy field, whom thou canst never
