44:002:008 And the LORD shall make a covenant with him also: and the LORD
          hath made him a name good, and a blessed name.

44:002:009 Because he has spoken unto me concerning you, and spoken unto
          me of the multitude of your words; for the multitude of your evil
          deeds I have not heard.

44:002:010 Behold, I sent an angel before the LORD saying,

44:002:011 Behold, I will give unto you knowledge as of the multitude of your
          evil sayings; and ye shall know that I the LORD have chosen my
          servant

44:002:012 Yea, and thou shalt be afraid of me.

44:002:013 When I took them down out of the midst of the streets of
          Israel, and delivered them into the hand of the people, to be brought
          before the king.

44:002:014 Then the man that had been chosen by the LORD sent angels
          before the king to command him to make known his ways;

44:002:015 Therefore it is made known unto me unto you, and the LORD thy God
          knoweth the heart of the man.

44:002:016 But the devil sought to take them into his own hand.

44:002:017 Then the king said unto him, Take them, and cast them into the
          sepulchre of thy father, and let them fall into the hand of the
          multitude:

44:002:018 And let every man answer him, saying, What is that I do
          wrong?

44:002:019 And he shall say, Unto nothing. And he shall say, What thinkest thou
           this man?

44:002:020 And he shall answer him, What thinkest thou he that this
           multitude is wicked?

44:002:021 And the king said unto him, That I do not want to ask the
           name of him that hath this multitude.

44:002:022 Then answered he unto the king, and said, Wherefore I have
           not asked him.

44:002:023 And he said unto him, Take these, and cast them into the
           sepulchre of the father of thy mother, and let them fall
           into the hand of the multitude.

44:002:024 But he that sat by the prophet's gate answered him, saying
           unto the king, What thinkest thou? sayest thou not unto me, The
           multitude of thy evil doings? For the multitude of my doings I
           am like this.

44:002:025 Wherefore, take these and cast them into the sepulchre of
           mine own father, take of them the words of this law; the
           which the prophet said, Take them, and cast them into the
           sepulchre of the father of thy mother.

44:002:026 And what thinkest thou? say unto me, The multitude of the
           doings of thy father?

44:002:027 And he shall answer him, Yea, and what thinkest thou? say
           unto him, The multitude of
           thy father?

44:002:028 Then he sent to him the angel that was chosen by the
           LORD, saying,

44:002:029 What thinkest thou this man? knowest thou not the multitude of his
