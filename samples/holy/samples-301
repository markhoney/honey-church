 with and against the Jews, that they may destroy him;
that he be destroyed, and that the righteous suffer to the glory of the
fearful; that the righteous have been the chosen of God by the power of God,
in the midst of the multitude of the children of men; that they will
be judged with the judges of the world. And now, let them
see how that thou hast fulfilled the work which thou hast done; because of the
sorrow and afflictions of the people, the Jews were angry.

20:1 Now they said unto the congregation, Verily, the LORD God
approveth the deeds of the men who do wicked deeds. And they said unto
them, Let us take unto us the people, who have been guilty of this.

So they took them and scattered them in such wise that they were scattered
through the river valley of the sons of Levi, and in their tents, according to
their number, and to their country, and in the cities, and in their cities,
and they took unto them, and delivered them unto them, and gave them
them their lands, their houses and their inheritances unto them; the land was
gathered of thousands; their land, their lands, their lands, even all their
souls.

20:2 And the people of Judah went down to the place, and
went forth to fight against the people of Jerusalem. Nevertheless, before they did
so, they did it with great courage; but not of the same courage was
they like unto the city of the children of Israel.

20:3 And the people of Jerusalem fought not as the people of Judah did: but
they were not of the same spirit, because the LORD of hosts dealt a
dispute with the people of Judah.

20:4 And the people of this city did not rise up against the people, neither
went to Jerusalem with the battle; but they went down, and returned as they went
down, and departed, and went their way.

20:5 Thus they were scattered, with their tents; and it
was not according to their numbers for that they were so scattered in like manner;
but according to their number they went up against them, and did battle.

20:6 And the soldiers of the people gathered unto Jerusalem, and
went forth to fight against the city of the people of the LORD their
envious.
