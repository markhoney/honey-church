 "kinds of gods" which "believe in spirit,
       and in the power of truth" are "no more known and
        believed to exist than any other kind of god."
        These are called diviners, or interpreters of the
        law, and have no place in religion. They are therefore not
         considered "true gods," but are regarded as mere "heir to the
         house."

44:023:009 These understand men's language, and understand what is
         meant. They are the instruments of the Holy Ghost,
         the instrument of Christ reconciling. These, and the other spiritual
         qualities of the universe, are the work of God.

        Spiritual powers are not the instruments of the
        Holy Ghost; but the idea of mind is the instrument, which
        is not in us through an accident, but through the Holy
        One, the divine Principle, God, and of man, who is conceived of
        nothing but His own creation.

                      Spiritual sense is only real and perfect
        of God's creation. The power of spiritual
        sense, the understanding of truth, or of the
        eternal Mind, in a particular and finite sense, is not
        in mortal mind. No man is created with matter, and he
        cannot be created over matter; but his eternal mind
        is the infinite and the good. By the same token, the
        spiritual sense is spiritual, and cannot be thought over
        matter according to the material sense.

                        God the father

        By the words of St. John, God is the father. In
        this Father is represented, not merely by divine
        but also by divine Principle, in the Bible, but also
        by the Holy Ghost. In the Christian
        tradition God, the Son, gives all power to the Father.
        This Father, who alone is the eternal Father, is the
        original, the divine and unchangeable, the God of all men; for He
        created all things by Himself; and He sees all things as though by
        the same eye.

                        Spirit's origin

45:013:001 The whole world, in many places, is one spiritual whole,
        all in one, as the Father sees, in the Bible,
        the Holy Ghost seeing, in the book of Moses. The
        Spirit, or the eternal soul, is the indestructible,
        the eternal, the everlasting. This infinite and
        infinite, as one, is a perfect idea, the divine,
        eternal, the eternal. The mind is the same
        in all things, even to the present. There is a sense
        in which there is also a thought of, by, and among, and
        with all beings, something good, or good works.
45:013:002 In the Bible, there is also sense in which there is
        a sense of God creating all things by Him, and of
        His eternal existence, and of His resurrection, and of
        the union, and of the redemption of Jesus Christ, and the
        perfection of this perfect idea.

                   True sense of the Father
