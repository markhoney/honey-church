       unto all the world, and all the ends of the earth;

27:025:023 I will cause it to be a desolate place; and it shall be
         like a broken vessel, that it may neither serve any more; where
         men cannot tread any more to drink of it, to the edge of the
         great sea shall not stand.

27:025:024 For he will put great mountains under his foot, and he will
          set an everlasting place under him.

27:025:025 And he will establish it as a law, saying, As far as the
          LORD is, so is.

27:025:026 In the wilderness shall the mountain be cut; whither the
          mountains should not stand, therefore he will take the mountains,
          and he will establish them.

27:025:027 I will scatter them in the four quarters all over the land,
          and will bring a sword upon them, and it shall fall
          upon them upon the great river.

27:025:028 Yea, they will drink, because they have sinned against
          all the law, and have not obeyed the voice of
          his voice.

27:025:029 Hear the word of the LORD in Zion,

27:025:030 Which I will send the wind of the Lord, and will
          blow it in his place among his towns: and the wind that
          bloweth therein shall be as a strong wind in the
          land.

27:025:031 Yea, in that day will I cause the mountain to
          be broken down before the sword: the mount shall
          be taken away, and shall be a desolate place: and the name of
          the mountain shall not have any remembrance, nor any
          name for it: it shall be a wild beast, and a broken
          vessel; it shall have none that dwell under it: it shall be
          destroyed: but the name of the mountains shall remain under
          it.

27:025:032 And then shall no inhabitant of any of the wilderness,
           when soever it shall be broken, go up by it, and
           take it up: but let the inhabitants of Jerusalem rejoice,
           and they that go out of it shall not fail of that which
            standeth before the sword.

27:025:033 Hear the word of the LORD, which the Lord spake to Isaiah
            the Babylonian, which brought him back into Egypt,

27:025:034 The word of the LORD, which the Lord said unto me, I know that thou
             have heard of the goodness and mercy of the Lord;

27:025:035 Thus saith the LORD in Zion's house, the holy place, and
            of the LORD's house;

27:025:036 Thus saith the LORD, The word of the LORD had it not been
            spoken, for the wind was against me to destroy me, and the mountain
            had I not said it was, but the LORD had it unto say it.

27:025:037 Yet now, behold, the Lord hath spoken it; for the word
           which he commanded me in Zidon, that he should do it;

27:025:038 Thus saith the LORD of Israel in Jerusalem; Set it in
           the midst of the people, and be not of those that fear not,
