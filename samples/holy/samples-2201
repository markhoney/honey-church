003:015 He hath put off his garment, yea, in the midst of his garments;
          and hath not eaten bread;

05:014:016 But he holdeth all the other matters, like the host of heaven,
           his glory and his power: the same also hath cast out the light of
           vanity; and brought back unto him thy sons, thy daughters, and thy
           children, and thy manservants that bare thee.

05:014:017 Now therefore remember my words, O ye Gentiles; for they are
           sufficient unto thee for an ensample, and an example of
           thyself in Zion, and in the holy temple: for in them ye
           have an inheritance; and unto each of you I say, Take, do away
           this.

05:014:018 For in that days also will I be come to this temple, and I will see
           the house of Israel there; there saith the Lord GOD, I am in
           Jerusalem, and I will be seen of the house of Israel.

05:014:019 They that dwell in Zion also shall hear, and their children shall behold
           it, and shall cry unto Jerusalem: for they go forth from thence
           for fear.

05:014:020 Go forth, then from thence, and from the city, and from the posts of it,
           saying, Where is Jerusalem? go ye not forth as the people of Nephi
           have done in the land of promise?

05:014:021 For because I have taken thy brethren and thy children,

05:014:022 Then have I done with thee; and have put off thy garments in the midst
           thereof, and have cut thy teeth out at thy mouth with a harp;
           and hath covered thee with a robe of mourning: and I have
           laid a sword in thy mouth, which hath not spoken; to cover thee
           with mourning and weeping, because I have brought thee to the ends
           of the earth.

05:014:023 Therefore the children of Nephi shall mourn, and the princes of the
           land shall be in mourning, and the elders thereof shall be
           grieved because thereof.

05:013:001 Then said the LORD unto Joshua the priest, How hath the
           hand of the king fallen, and the hand of all the people
           fallen; how have they forsaken the name of my people: and the
           people of Nephi have not rebelled against me, neither
           have we forsaken my servant;

05:013:002 But have sat idly in the midst of the people unto day
           even now, neither have they heard my words, nor have
           thought to know them: and now have we heard but that ye
           were of the house of Nephi, and I am of the house of Jacob:

05:013:003 I have cast out your idols, your sacrifices, and your
           oblations, and have destroyed your princes, and your
           priests, your chief ministers;

05:013:004 In the sight of your gods, and your idols, in the sight of their
           eyes; and ye were taken out of your land.

05:013:005 And I have laid up this iniquity against your kings, that ye should have
           no part in the land: and I have delivered it into your hands
