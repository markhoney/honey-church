19:007:008 It is wisdom not to look up unto God, lest he turn away his
          hand upon thee:

19:007:009 And thou hast heard the truth: but thy desire of
            understanding, and thy desire of glory, hath departed.

19:007:010 And now, O LORD God, hear ye the words which they
            speak unto the children of Israel, saying, As for me, I will be a
            widow,

19:007:011 And I will be an afflicted woman: but thy words are
            of light, and I will dwell in the city that thou hast
            chosen.

19:007:012 As for me, my name is only vanity: my life is like gold,
            and my substance shall be as butter: and the glory of them round
            about me shall not pass away, saith the LORD.

19:007:013 Moreover the LORD smote them that did speak with him before, where
            they had not the words for their fear, and they were smitten with their
            fingers.

19:007:014 Howbeit he took not away their heart from the LORD, nor departed
            far from his house to return to it: he walked in the
            ways that the LORD had taught him.

19:007:015 The LORD will recompense the wicked by the sword; it is for the
            wicked that they shall enter into exile.

19:007:016 As for me, my name is vanity:

19:007:017 Which will give me to morrow the place of the people of the
            LORD, unto a great mountain; yea, even a great mountain.

19:007:018 Wherefore, in that great mountain shall a great king sit; he shall
           eat bread like chattels, and he shall be a prey: and his
           servants shall eat bread as chattels, and his food as chattels.

19:007:019 He shall leave nothing but the remnant of them that shall be slain: neither
           shall they eat meat like chattels; neither shall they eat bread as
           chattels: neither shall they drink wine as chattels; neither shall they
           eat meat as chattels; neither shall they drink wine of gold
           like gold; so shalt thou make Israel a place of prey, and
          Jerusalem an abomination.

19:007:020 The LORD is the God of Israel: and the LORD is the God of every
          nation, after him as David.

19:007:021 And when I was come, they brought bread: but they brought bread not
          of themselves.

19:007:022 For the place was desolate: neither wast I with them in the
          wilderness, nor dwelt, nor had I meat in the field.

19:007:023 Thus saith the LORD saying unto the king, Behold, the earth, and
          the sea, and ye shall give to them according to their work:
          as for the trees, saith the LORD God, which giveth the light to the
          lamp.

19:007:024 Thou shalt therefore, as that tree and thy vine, be
          rooted out from thee, that the ground may bring forth fruits, and the
          fruits may be for food:

19:007:025 And thou shalt build pillars to thee, and be the pillars of thy house: thou
