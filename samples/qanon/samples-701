If there is a 'targeted' terrorist attack (plan or specific location), that should serve as 'proof' needed to obtain a warrant(s)/indict(ing). 
"Prevent." - J. Lawsuit Listen carefully re: timeline of events. 
"The target is those who attack the most heavily." - J. Lawsuit
Why did we receive a redacted 'copy' of the 'prevent plan to strike' document when subpoenaed to produce earlier today? 
Why was the 'targeted' attack of 'prevent' to re: 'targeted' occur within the span of a few short days, precisely coinciding w/ the release of a new DHS 'Blueprint'? 
Why is this relevant? 
Did DOJ/FBI/NSA/C_A members 'knowingly' break 'red' security classification rules by removing, adding, removing, adding, modifying, modifying, deleting, and/or re-re-deploying classified markings? 
When did the breach become public? 
Where did these classified markings go?

What "red" classifications were added (redacted)?
What other classified markings were added re: that classifications have been 'redacted' to prevent 'abduction'.

What other classified markings were added re: the 'redacted' evidence collection requirements of PJC Section I superseding (redacted) criminal indictments and superseding the direct evidence collection requirements of RC (RC being the primary classifier)? 
Why would this matter? 
Redactions protect 'important' facts re: criminal indictments, facts re: FBI/DOJ # 1 tampering, facts re: FBI/DOJ # 2 special agents tampering, facts re: DOJ # 1/DOJ # 2/Special Agents in evidence tampering, etc.
Why would this matter? 
Would dropping such 'red' classifications harm future 'impeachment' attempts by prosecutors/judges re: failure to drop 'red' charges/proceedings (especially if the proof at the end of the day is that the proof was all for show)? 
"The evidence will show" - J. Lawsuit
"It will be made public." - PJC
"You were warned." - J. Lawsuit 
Do not be fooled by your 'media' mouthpieces who speak in a soothing voice that can be lulled into complacency by the near universal hatred of corrupt politicians. 
Hate for corrupt politicians who, in reality, harbor unavowable hatred against God and the Constitution of the United States (Article 1, Section 9).

The choice, [D] people have now [F]
We, the PEOPLE, have the final word on this matter. Make NO mistake, [D] people will come together on the subject of immigration (both legal and illegal) and that this is a civil rights issue, not an immigration issue. The time is now, it is [finally] clear, and the choice, [D] people, has now [F]
There will be no amnesty. There will be no political cover. There will be no 'controversy' re: implementation of 'anchor babies' due to fear of the 'anchor baby' syndrome. There will be a thorough, concerted, and violent attack (domestic terrorism) on those who threaten the established order and the survival of the nation. There will be no compromise, only swift and total destruction. POTUS will NOT be blackmailed under the false guise (threat) of a 'soft' solution (solution which, through the application of science, demonstrates the correctness, necessity, and desirability of continuing to grant illegal status to illegal residents of the United States). The people are being prepared to face the truth. The choice, [D] people, has now [F]
There will be no further negotiations (negotiation/coup/whatever) about immigration (except (likely) under the auspices of the [Pelosi] [L] House. There will be no further negotiations (negotiation/coup/whatever) regarding America's future relations w/ the People's Republic of China. There will be a great deal of violence on the streets (at least temporarily) in response to the evil and corruption engendered by this President and his gang of eight (presently six). There will be a great deal of peaceful protest by both illegal residents of the United States and legal residents of the Nation (including civil society groups). There will be a great deal of physical violence by gangs, by individuals, and by other means (including infiltration, sabotage and removal).
