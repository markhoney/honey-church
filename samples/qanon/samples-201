<|startoftext|>In the video clip below, Hillary Clinton can be seen trying to change the subject from her "basket of deplorables" to a discussion of her alleged record. You are witnessing the latest development in the Clinton 'Russia' investigation. https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2017/07/12/trump-attacks-the-clinton-foundation-as-worth-less-than-$1/4e5c2408-e1e6-11e2-9fb9-c3d2-b4e3-5bb8bfdf5a5e_story.html
In today's world, where are the 'good' liberals?
For those 'hardcore' of our breed, Clinton Foundation is a HUGE problem.
It is not about money. <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How long will Hillary refuse to release transcripts (which are the only records left)?
How long will her own 'security' keep 'all' of the info to herself?
What is the actual reason her 'security' was put in these posts on Twitter and Facebook? 
Why are the most prominent left-wing media figures 're-tweeting' the exact same posts (which have the exact same source/text)?
Why are the most prominent left-wing media figures promoting 'facts' (which are often either outright lies (as in 'the most recent polls/analysis) to change the narrative-tactics) that completely contradicts 'facts'?
Why are they so desperate?
What happens when 'a' party wins the majority of voting in a particular state?
What happens when a 'Party' control (party of the people) (in)examples-to-pro-Democratic-party establishment?
What happens when 'a' party gains control of public media, and begins 'to use' such 'entertainment? 
What happens when a 'Group of People' are controlled? 
What happens when 'a' party holds a 'large' public opinion, and controls media/media narrative for themselves (in order to appeal to mass public opinion)?
When in control?
These people are sick.

Who controls the truth?
Who controls the narrative? #FactsMatter #FactsMatter

This was going to be very BIG.
Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"When we have the means to stop what is happening [control of 'our'] we act, and the responsibility of this act lies with the great mass of people to defend themselves against these dangers, and to form organizations (if sufficient) which will be able to provide the means for defending their interests."

"When I saw the picture I couldn't help but think of how I had to be the perfect representation of the man in the picture. 
I remember standing in the woods and holding the picture for dear life. 
It was never about me or my image (but instead, it was about creating an event which would show you everything I was so scared of 'that day.' "
Trolling will not work.

<|startoftext|>I guess you could argue this is an attempt to keep the focus on 'a' specific person vs. this entire discussion, and to push the conversation back and forth.
This is what these days are all about.

Think for yourself.
I know you can 'defend your position' if you can be 'truth-telling' and 'vocal' about what you feel.
But this isn't 'public opinion.'
These people (or 'others') are 'terrorists,' and this will 'kill them.'
We were scared for you. 
You are needed.
