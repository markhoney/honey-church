 as "the Great Awakening" and the end of the "conspiracy to protect the masses from what is about to come"?
The answer is no. 
In order to understand the meaning of the word "Reaching," take the story of the PATRIOT movement.

Why was Mueller appointed?
He is a patriot [leader].
We must all stand by and support him!
"You are witnessing the greatest effort to delegitimize an elected President and to replace him with [D] party establishment."
"Nunes [proved] illegal conduct [prosecution of Flynn]. 
Nunes called for a probe into [D] party collusion, illegal FBI actions, corruption, racism, and treason."
The problem was never Flynn.
The problem was never POTUS.
The problem was never 'Russian 'Collusion'.
The problem was never "Russian 'collusion'."
The problem is 'We know' [procedural]
The problem is 'what if'
The problem is 'why'
The problem is 'how'
The problem is 'which'
The problem, by definition, is non NIRP [analogous].
The problem, by definition, is TRUTH [a person who has a rational, objective, and consistent view of the facts, regardless of their beliefs, opinion, or choice of actions.]
As the New York Times pointed out, NUNES "has asked for a closed-door investigation into [D]s' efforts to rig the election against POTUS and to confirm [D] criminal charges against him."
For those who are too lazy to watch the news, what does this have to have to do with NUNES.
Nothing. 
"Comey [confirms] the FBI had no information tying Russia to the Republican Presidential nominee during the election."
What is going on?

The reason the story was published in the first place was to ensure that if the investigation continued on its current track that the NURSE would not be announced as in-progress. This was to ensure that if there were further developments by NUNES that the investigation could continue and that if the investigation progressed that it would not be considered finished."
Why did this matter?
The investigation will not stop. The investigation will not stop [the public from being informed via the mass media].
The investigation will not stop (the public realizing what is actually unfolding).
The investigation is not only about NUNES but also about a plethora of other political allies (leaders, candidates).
The investigation will not stop for this reason.

People have a right to speak.
People have a right to assemble.
People have a right to protest.
People have a right to hold a 'conspiracy' (in order to prevent further violence and usurp authority). 
The most basic reason to oppose 'Crowd-Funding' by NUNES [refer to the effort on the part of a few individuals to steal the election & discredit the 'Rally for Truth' campaign] would be to prevent those in leadership positions from revealing that their actions (pro-CNS) would be necessary to prevent 'political' interference w/o disclosure of 'public' knowledge. 
People have a right to know.
People have a right to have an informed opinion. 
People have a right to challenge injustice. 
People have a right to be free from being controlled.
