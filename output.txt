"For, lo, a great and abominable, abomination is come into this place; there is nothing in this great and abominable
place that hath the power of its commandment, according as it is written." [Moses]

1 Esdr 15:10
Moreover the Lord said unto Moses, If ye speak to any people to
speak good, say, Ye shall not speak evil; for they are of an unlawful
speech of their own accord.

1 Esdr 15:11
And after the lawgiver said unto the LORD, Speak unto the
heathen of the Lord, that they may teach in their own lands of
the good word, and that they may not speak wickedly; for they shall
never be accepted into their lands of their inheritance, until the day of
peace be fulfilled.

1 Esdr 15:12
And the LORD spake again unto Moses:

1 Esdr 15:13
In the name of God, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob, and of Jesus, and of the Holy One of Israel, say unto the
people of the land; that ye may not speak evil against them
that dwell in the land of Canaan: and speak also unto all the
heathen a good word, to the honour of their God, which hath
said, Thou shalt neither speak evil against them of a truth.

1 Esdr 15:14 Ye shall not speak evil against them to your
sins, neither shalt ye speak evil against them to your
goods; for their name shall be blessed among the people:
for the LORD also hath spoken.

1 Esdr 15:15
And I brought forth the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they
should not walk in the way of the heathen nor fall to their
betrayal; and that there should be no covenant between me and you
against the heathen.

1 Esdr 15:16
And after they said unto Moses, The Son is in the ark of
the covenant of the LORD: wherefore let us be good to our God, the
Father, who has sworn by the LORD, that he would shew
his faith to thee by his own tongue, that he might take
hold on thee of the people that dwell in the land; and for him
to bring forth the testimony of God.

1 Esdr 15:17
For as the word which is spoken among the children of Israel
and of the heathen is the word of the true God; even so the word which
is spoken among you and of the heathen is the word of the
God, whom ye have sworn to serve him.

[The name of this place being changed the text, which
describes the ark as being used by the Israelites in the
first year of the second decade, is changed with the alteration,
from the day of the covenant of the LORD with Abraham, and with
Israel, in the month Yebbish.<|endoftext|>By the Lord

I am Peter K. Smith, Pastor of First United Methodist Church, in my city of Philadelphia, and I invite you to watch a special video about the Lord and what He requires of your worship
today.

In our Bible study we talk about how we pray to the Father. We ask, then, why is it we do not call on
God's name? We ask, then, why are we ashamed of saying, "Lord, we are sorry we have
not been willing to do this, nor so much as to do that." And we ask, then, why do
we not go to church? But there are so many of us in need of that "what is our need?" We are
begged to take your blessings. And sometimes those times of need are so desperate, so much
desolation, and all too short of time.

There is no need, either in the midst of it, to be sorry that you have not been
worshipful, in prayer, or in our Scriptures. You do not need to be sorry that you
have not said, "I am grateful for that which you have sent me." You need to
be grateful that no one has asked you to do this. You need to be grateful that
you have left your sins to the judge of God instead of to the judge of the
people of your Lord.

How is it possible that God calls on His people to be sorry? You cannot
do that. You cannot even pray to the Father of Truth for His willfulness. You
need God, and no need of repentance to obtain His grace on His part.

But what is the need of repentance? Not one good deed of yours, for that
is the need of God. And the way you can be sorry? By repenting

              to the king in whose hand the king is, and his counsellors
            shall deliver him to be hanged; that all these may be
            delivered with the sword, and all their children with the
            murderers.

16:006:013 And when this is done, and the king reigneth in his stead, even
            he saith unto the king, Art thou king? and he sayeth, Nay
            but I am not such an a king as thou art.

16:006:014 And King David, when the king was dead, called for his sword, and
            slew King David. And after three days that king was dead.

16:006:015 And he called the body of David his own.

16:006:016 And there were of David his servants the Levites, and the
            priests, and the Levites themselves, and kept it. And when I
            was king, thou, and I, went forth from thence to Jerusalem.

16:006:017 Then king Solomon had twenty and seven thousand and twenty
            thousand men; and thirty thousand and more than thirty
            thousand horses, and five thousand and more than
            the thousand and twenty thousand footmen, and three and eighty
            vessels of war.

16:006:018 And he sent for Elisha, and he sent four thousand
            and fifteen thousand horsemen.

16:006:019 And he sent again, and again twelve thousand and
            fifteen thousand footmen, and four hundred and
            thirty thousand and two hundred and thirty thousand
            vessels of war.

16:006:020 And he sent again for the two hundred and twenty
            thousand and ten thousand and three hundred and
            two thousand and threescore thousand gentry, and twelve
            thousand and ten thousand and five hundred and
            two thousand gentry, the four hundred and thirty
            gentry and six hundred, thirty and fifty vessels of
            gentry.

16:006:021 In the same month also were there sent for the gentry of
            the king's army, every one with his master and partner in
            the king's service, ten thousand gentry, and two
            hundred gentry.

16:006:022 And after this went for the gentry of the gentry of
            the king's service, the gentry of his father's service,
            forty thousand gentry, and seven thousand and eighty
            gentry.

16:006:023 And the king sent also four times for the gentry of the king
            of Babylon to keep the king's service, to keep the office of
            the king, and to keep his own fee, and for his money a place over
            the king's house by the way.

16:006:024 And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that the king
            died.

                                         David the child

15:001:001 In the beginning of the end of king David we read in the





















003:015 He hath put off his garment, yea, in the midst of his garments;
          and hath not eaten bread;

05:014:016 But he holdeth all the other matters, like the host of heaven,
           his glory and his power: the same also hath cast out the light of
           vanity; and brought back unto him thy sons, thy daughters, and thy
           children, and thy manservants that bare thee.

05:014:017 Now therefore remember my words, O ye Gentiles; for they are
           sufficient unto thee for an ensample, and an example of
           thyself in Zion, and in the holy temple: for in them ye
           have an inheritance; and unto each of you I say, Take, do away
           this.

05:014:018 For in that days also will I be come to this temple, and I will see
           the house of Israel there; there saith the Lord GOD, I am in
           Jerusalem, and I will be seen of the house of Israel.

05:014:019 They that dwell in Zion also shall hear, and their children shall behold
           it, and shall cry unto Jerusalem: for they go forth from thence
           for fear.

05:014:020 Go forth, then from thence, and from the city, and from the posts of it,
           saying, Where is Jerusalem? go ye not forth as the people of Nephi
           have done in the land of promise?

05:014:021 For because I have taken thy brethren and thy children,

05:014:022 Then have I done with thee; and have put off thy garments in the midst
           thereof, and have cut thy teeth out at thy mouth with a harp;
           and hath covered thee with a robe of mourning: and I have
           laid a sword in thy mouth, which hath not spoken; to cover thee
           with mourning and weeping, because I have brought thee to the ends
           of the earth.

05:014:023 Therefore the children of Nephi shall mourn, and the princes of the
           land shall be in mourning, and the elders thereof shall be
           grieved because thereof.

05:013:001 Then said the LORD unto Joshua the priest, How hath the
           hand of the king fallen, and the hand of all the people
           fallen; how have they forsaken the name of my people: and the
           people of Nephi have not rebelled against me, neither
           have we forsaken my servant;

05:013:002 But have sat idly in the midst of the people unto day
           even now, neither have they heard my words, nor have
           thought to know them: and now have we heard but that ye
           were of the house of Nephi, and I am of the house of Jacob:

05:013:003 I have cast out your idols, your sacrifices, and your
           oblations, and have destroyed your princes, and your
           priests, your chief ministers;

05:013:004 In the sight of your gods, and your idols, in the sight of their
           eyes; and ye were taken out of your land.

05:013:005 And I have laid up this iniquity against your kings, that ye should have
           no part in the land: and I have delivered it into your hands



























1:17 But the word that came to me from the LORD, which I heard, saith the Lord GOD,
               that Moroni was a spy;

1:18 Till a man, that will not go out into the field,
             be found in the fields, and set upon a wagon, and
             lie on it, and it shall be a snare unto him, and
            he shall fall into the trap.

1:19 And it came to pass, the son of the woman that was
            betrothed to him said unto her brother, Thy brother, who
            is betrothed to thy brother, is gone to dwell with
            the man.

1:20 And it came to pass that the man said unto his brother, Who
            thou? And his brother answered, The man that is betro
            with thee. And he said unto his brother, Thy brother is betrothed
            to thy brother.

1:21 And it came to pass the same day, that the man that was betrothed
            to the woman that was betrothed to him came to the man, and said,
            My brother is betrothed to my brother; thou hast no more brother.

1:22 And he said unto him, My brother is betrothed to me: the man
            that is betrothed to my brother is gone to dwell with me.

1:23 And he said unto him, I have seen it; it is a man of God. And
            he said, Yes, it is an angel. And he said, Go, and be with him.

1:24 And another man followed him, and said, My brother is betrothed to me;
            my brother is betrothed to me; my brother is gone to dwell with me.

1:25 And he said, Go, and be with him: I have seen it. And he said,
            Ye, sir; and when he had seen it, he said, Go with him. And the
            man said unto him, I am come to see my brother. And he said, Go with
            him.

1:26 And he said, I know that he is a man of God, and that he
            is come to me to know that he hath been betrothed to me; he
            said, Take him, and go ye to his brother. And he said, I am called
            to be his brother; go with him.

1:27 And he said, I am called to be his brother; go with me. And he said,
            Ye, sir; and when he had seen it, he said, Go with him. And he
            said, I know that he is a man of God; and I also know that he is
            a prophet, and that he is called from the Lord, and that he declares
            things that are true, and that I should believe all that he
            declare.

1:28 And when he had seen what was written, he said, I know that he is a
            man of God: and I also know that he is a prophet, and that he declare
            things that are true, that I should not believe.

1:29 And when he had seen the maiden of the house, and the maidens of
            the house, and the bet
